/**
 
 This code uses the JPanel and Graphics2D classes to draw the fractal tree on the screen. The drawFractal() method uses recursion
 to draw the branches and leaves of the tree. The drawBranch() and drawLeaf() methods are used to draw each branch and leaf,
 respectively. The calculateEndPoint() method is used to calculate the end points of the branches.

/**

 A fractal is a mathematical object that exhibits self-similarity at different scales. This means that the same pattern 
 or structure repeats itself at different levels of magnification. The concept of self-similarity is at the heart of 
 fractal geometry, and it is what gives fractals their distinctive and often intricate shapes.
 One of the most famous examples of a fractal is the Mandelbrot set, named after the mathematician BenoÃ®t Mandelbrot who 
 first studied it in the 1980s. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that satisfy a certain mathematical condition.
 When plotted on the complex plane, the numbers in the Mandelbrot set form a distinctive and intricate pattern that repeats 
 itself at different scales.
 The fractal tree shown in the previous example is a simple example of a fractal. The tree is created by recursively drawing 
 branches and leaves at different levels of magnification. The same branching pattern is repeated at each level, giving the 
 tree its self-similar structure.
 Fractals are found in many natural phenomena, such as the branching patterns of trees and rivers, the shape of coastlines and 
 mountains, and the distribution of galaxies in the universe. They are also used in many fields, such as computer graphics, data 
 compression, and finance.
